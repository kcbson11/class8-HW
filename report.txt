Summary Report – ArgoCD and GitOps
Overview

In this assignment, I installed ArgoCD on a Minikube cluster, deployed applications using Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts, and utilized Hooks and Sync Waves. I also explored multi-cluster management principles and demonstrated the Self-Heal feature.

Challenges and Solutions

CLI in PowerShell – special characters and parameters were not recognized.
Solution: Used backtick (`) for line continuation.

Accessing ArgoCD CLI – initial token was invalid.
Solution: Retrieved the initial password via kubectl and logged in again.

Helm Chart Deployment – release name errors.
Solution: Used a valid release name and local values.yaml, deployed via ArgoCD UI.

Multi-Cluster Management in Minikube – ArgoCD could not reach cluster2.
Solution: Demonstrated multi-application deployment on cluster1 and verified cluster2 existence using minikube status.

Key Learnings

Using ArgoCD for GitOps-based application management: synchronization, drift detection, and automatic correction.

Proper deployment order using Sync Waves and Hooks.

Managing resources: Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, ReplicaSets, and Jobs.

Understanding multi-cluster concepts and testing in a local environment.

Strengthening problem-solving skills in CLI and UI.

Conclusion

This assignment provided hands-on experience in deploying and managing applications with ArgoCD and GitOps, including change tracking, automatic synchronization, and demonstrating advanced Kubernetes management principles.
